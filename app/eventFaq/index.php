					</ul><br>
				<li>Dirty Brickster</li>
					<ul>
						<li> Each participant brings exactly one wrapped gift. Each gift
should be Lego or Lego-related, cost about $10, and be worth $10–$20 *to
the recipient*. Hence, no “junk” (clones, most Lego “gear”, etc.). When
the Dirty Brickster begins, participants sit in a circle with the
gifts piled in the center and draw numbers. In the order of the numbers,
each participant chooses a gift by either (1) unwrapping one or (2)
by stealing a non-locked gift. In the event that a participant’s gift is
stolen, he has the same choices, except that he may not steal back the
gift that was just stolen (altho triplets are allowed). Gifts are automatically locked after being
stolen for the third time. After the participant with the last number
chooses a gift, all gifts have been unwrapped. The participant with
number 1 may at that time elect to steal any non-locked gift, beginning a
new round of theft. After that, the Dirty Brickster is over.</li>
					</ul><br>
				<li>LEGO Poker</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Each participant, gets a stack of chips, and plays till they either win or lose them all. Texas Hold’em style. Last player standing wins.</li>

			<ul>
				<li>Yes, the exact makeup of the swag will not be determined until all sponsorship and promotional items are included, but we can say there already some sweet swag items coming to registered attendees, and some lucky members of the public.</li>
			</ul><br>
		<li>Q. Do I have to pre-register my MOC?</li>
			<ul>
				<li>No, but when we run out of space to display MOC, we are out of space, plus if you pre-register your MOC, you’ll have a nicely printed display tag instead of a hand written one. </li>
