HOW TO CONFIGURATION THE GMAIL CLIENT

The gmail oauth will expire every 6 months which is ironic because we typically have a
bunch of activity until June and then nothing until February and the token expires

The same token can be used locally and on the server.


Step 1- go to https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground/
Step 2- login as brickslopes@gmail.com
Step 3- "Use your own OAuth credentials"
Step 4- Input the Oauth Client Id and OAuth Client secret from the config/config.php file
Step 5- "Step 1 Select & authorize APIs"
Step 6- Select Gmail API v1 > https://mail.google.com
Step 7- Authorize APIs
Step 8- "Step 2 Exchange authorization doe for tokens"
Step 9- Click "Exchange authorization code for tokens" button
Step 10- Copy "Refresh token" and "Access Token" to the config/credentials_token.json file
Step 11- Push the code to the server
