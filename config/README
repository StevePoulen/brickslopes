HOW TO CONFIGURATION THE GMAIL CLIENT

The gmail oauth will expire every 6 months which is ironic because we typically have a
bunch of activity until June and then nothing until February and the token expires

The same token can be used locally and on the server.

Step 1- rename the config/credentials_token.json
Step 2- php /app/php/lib/gmailOAuth.php
Step 3- copy the url
Step 4- login as brickslopes@gmail.com
Step 5- Take the token and get the access_token and refresh_token
Step 6- Put the two parameters in the credentials_token.json file and rename it back
Step 7- Rerun Step #2
